    Because of the evaporation, the volume of water contained in a pool decreases by 3\% per week.
    The initial volume of water is 90 m$^3$.
    
    Use your calculator to answer the following questions, and explain your method.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute the volume of water in the pool after 2 weeks, after 8 weeks.
        \item Jack says that the volume of water will have decreased by 30\% after 12 weeks. Do you agree with him? Explain your answer.
    \end{enumerate}}
In order to compensate for the loss of water, 2.4 m$^3$
of water are added in the pool every week.
Letâ€™s consider the following  \textsc{Python} script :
\begin{pyc}
    \begin{minted}{python}
        from math import *

        def pool():
            n = 0
            u = 90
            while u > 88:
                n = n + 1
                u = 0.97 * u + 2.4
            return n
    \end{minted}
\end{pyc}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Describe and explain this script. How does it relate to the problem?
    \item What is the result when you execute \mintinline{python}{pool()} ? What does it mean? Draw a conclusion.
\end{enumerate}
