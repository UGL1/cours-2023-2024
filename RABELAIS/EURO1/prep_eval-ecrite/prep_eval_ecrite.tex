My uncle owns a farm. In his yard, he keeps cows and hens. When I visited him last week, I counted 50 heads and 162 "feet".\\
How many hens and cows does my uncle own ?

\begin{encadrecolore}{Solution}{UGLiRed}
    Firstly, let's name the unknown quantities : $x$ will denote the number of cows and $y$ the number of chickens.\\
    Assuming
    \begin{itemize}
        \item all animals have one head (which is fairly reasonable)
        \item a hen has two feet 
        \item a cow has 4
    \end{itemize}
    we get two equations : 
    $$x+y=50\qquad(1)$$
    because adding $x$ cow heads and $y$ duck heads give us 50 heads, and
    $$4x+2y = 162\qquad (2)$$
    when we account for the feet.\\
    Let's multiply both sides of $(1)$ by 2, we get $$2x+2y = 100\qquad (3)$$
    We can now subtract $(3)$ to $(2)$, which gives us
    $$2x = 62$$
    Now we have the value of $x$ : it's 31.\\
    Replacing $x$ by $31$ in $(1)$, we finally find that $y=19$.\\
    
    Thus, the uncle owns 31 cows and 19 hens.
