{\brettley 

Draw two perpendicular lines and a circle whose center is their intersection.
Choose one of this two lines. It has two points of intersection with the circle. By one of these points, draw a line parallel to the other. By the other one, draw a line passing through one intersection of the circle with the second line. This line intersects the parallel you drew before in a point which will be the center of a last circle, passing by the intersection of the first circle with the second line.}\\
