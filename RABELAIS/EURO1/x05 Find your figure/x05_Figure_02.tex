{\brettley
Draw two perpendicular lines. Choose one line and draw a point on it. The point of intersection of the two lines and the point you drew are now the endpoints of a segment line which is the diameter of a circle. Draw another circle with a diameter twice as long, on the second line, also passing by the intersection point. Draw a line parallel to the first one and passing through the intersection of this circle and the second line. Draw a line passing through the intersections of these two circles.}\\[1em]
