\section*{The original exercise}
\picright{0.3}{img/flag_ex.png}{
    Consider a huge red flag which is a rectangle of 5m by 8m. We'd like  to paint a white cross on it so that the area of this cross is equal to the red area which is left. Let $x$ be the width of the cross. What are the possible values of $x$ ?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Turn this problem into a mathematical equation.
    \item Solve this equation and answer the question.
    \item Criticize the exercise : what is the most displeasing with it ?
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Turning it into something more educational}

\picleft{0.3}{img/flag.png}{
    Now, let's call $a$ and $b$ the width and the height of the flag. How must we choose $a$ and $b$ so that $x$ is a decimal number and not an irrational one ?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the same as before but use $a$ and $b$ instead of 5 and 8 and get an equation.
    \item Find a "famous" property involving $a$ and $b$  which, when satisfied, produce a decimal solution for $x$.
    \item How can one find such couples $(a;b)$ ? 
\end{enumerate}
