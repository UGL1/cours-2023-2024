    Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, is a phenomenological law about the
    frequency distribution of leading digits in many (but not all) real-life sets of numerical data.

    The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers the small digits occur
    disproportionately often as leading significant digits. For example, in sets which obey the law the number 1 would appear as the most significant digit about 30\% of the time, while larger digits would occur in that position less frequently : 9 would appear less than 5\% of the time.

    It has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, population numbers\ldots}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item If all digits were distributed uniformly in a collection of numbers, what percentage would
          correspond to each number ?
    \item Give other examples where Benfordâ€™s law could be observed.
    \item The population of European Union countries in 2015 is given in the table below.

    \item The following graph represents the distribution of first digits, according to Benford's law. Each
          bar represents a digit, and the height of the bar is the percentage of numbers that starts with that
          digit.
