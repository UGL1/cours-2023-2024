\begin{exercice}[]
    Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates.

    \tabstyle[UGLiRed]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
            May 15    & May 16    & May 19    \\

            June 17   & June 18   &           \\

            July 14   & July 16   &           \\

            August 14 & August 15 & August 17 \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}


    Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.\\

    \textit{Albert}: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I'm sure Bernard doesn't know either.\\

    \textit{Bernard}: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday was, but now I do.\\

    \textit{Albert}: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.\\

    So when is Cheryl's birthday?
